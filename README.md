# Concept
This is Betti. Feeling competitive? Want to set ridiculous wagers? Like setting friendly bets between mates? You betcha. 
Betti is a simple and easy way to make non-monetary bets between friends. Simply sign up, set your bet, make your wager and send it to a friend. Once they accept, it’s game on. 
The more betti’s involved, the more users are able to contribute, vote and get inspiration for the next friendly bet to make. 


# User Story 
```
WHEN the first user makes a bet 
THEN the second user will then be notified via email of the deatils of the bet and wager
THEN the second user can accept or add modifications to the bet
IF modifications are made the first user must approve (handshake)
THEN the end date will be synced to BOTH users calendars 
THEN either user will need to perform the bet before the end date
WHEN the end date is reached either user can determine who has won lost or drawn. 
THEN a public record of the bets between these two users can be displayed on the page (hall of fame page)
